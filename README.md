# Brief description

# Citation

At this moment, you can reference Poisoned texts this way:

Cabedo, A. (2022). Poisoned texts. v.1.0 (beta). Available at https://github.com/acabedo/poisonedtexts

# Special mention and acknowledgments

Part of speech tagging is a mandatory input for Poisoned texts. That input won't be possible without the aid of UdPipe R Package (Wijffels 2022), available at https://github.com/bnosac/udpipe. In addition, the benefit of using Udpipe is that Poisoned texts can cover a bunch of different languages. By now, the selecting options are Spanish, Catalan, English, Italian, German, French, Portuguese and Chinese (this last one only in an experimental state); another languages can also be integrated with a very little modification of the app.

# Video tutorial

Some of the features of this script are shown in this short video:

# Online demo

An online version of Poisoned texts is available at https://adrin-cabedo.shinyapps.io/poisonedtexts/

# Sample reports generated

You can take a look to the report files generated by Poisonedtexts. These files include three different formats: PDF, Docx and html. You can check these reports at these link <https://github.com/acabedo/poisonedtexts/tree/main/samples/reports>

The sample TXT inputs are also available at [<https://github.com/acabedo/poisonedtexts/tree/main/samples/txts>](https://github.com/acabedo/poisonedtexts/tree/main/samples/test_txts_wikipedia). All these files have been taken literally from their online resources, i.e. Wikipedia, and they are only brief excerpts from the full entries.

# Inspirational work

Poisoned texts, as a very basic verbatim plagiarism detection tool, follows some of the rules developed by David Wools in Copycatch, version from 2003. Furthermore, the kind of ngrams treatment developed by Laurence Anthony in Antconc was considered a good trick to find verbatim coincidence and similarity among texts. Finally, the heatmap has been previously introduced and tested in other exploratory tools, like Oralstats [https://github.com/acabedo/oralstats]
